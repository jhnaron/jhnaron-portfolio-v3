        <h2>Hi there 😄</h2>
        <br /> <br />
        Name's Aron. Thanks for stopping by my website!
        <br /> <br />
        I'm a Software Engineer working with great people at Trend Micro PH.
        <br />
        I wanted to keep this website simple for its 3rd iteration since
        I've been pretty busy lately.
        <br /><br />
        If you're from LinkedIn, I'm currently happy working fulltime and not looking for any job.
        <br /> <br />
        And yes, dear friends, I am still alive and well! I just rarely check my socials nowadays. 
        But if you have my number, feel free to give me a call or send me a text instead. <br />
        <br /> <br />
        If you don't have my number, I still go through my emails regularly after work. ✌️
      <br />
